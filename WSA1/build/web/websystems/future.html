                In the future, I would like to work as a developer or programmer of some kind for a company, as I am currently majoring in 
                Enterprise Development. To add to this, I have been enjoying my experiences within the more programming intensive subjects
                such as Applications Programming so far and wish to get deeper into development and more hands-on computing despite the 
                potential workload.

                I have also done Networking and Database Fundamentals in the past. However, I find that these subjects are too
                theory-heavy in comparison to some of the more development-focused subjects. 

                Ultimately, my goal is to find work within a more "active" or "hands-on" sector of the IT industry, preferably as a 
                software or game developer.

                Personally, I would like to try my hand at developing some applications on my own as a hobby, preferably something
                like a game where I can work on multiple aspects at once (Sound, Gameplay and Visuals). Other than that, I wouldn't mind
                creating a startup project for fun with a few of my friends that are in the same course.

                There have been a few startup projects in the past that seem to be quite successful and fun such as the farming game
                Stardew Valley that was developed by a single person over the span of 4 years. I find this to be quite inspiring and would 
                someday like to attempt something of my own maybe on a smaller scale.
