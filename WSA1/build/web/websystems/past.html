            <p class="stdtxt">
                In highschool, I did a few electives that were related to information technology most notably:
            </p>
                <ul class="stdtxt">
                    <li>Information Software and Technology (Years 9-10)</li>
                    <li>Information Processes and Technology (Years 11-12)</li>
                </ul>
            <pre class="stdtxt">
                These electives gave me a rough idea of what to expect in the IT field but were quite theory heavy in my opinion, 
                being mainly focused upon covering the fundamentals of core IT principles e.g. Networking and Databases.

                However, the occasional practicals and assignments were what kept me in the course. Throughout the years I have
                created a series of databases, simple websites, videos, a simple scratch game and even a flash animation.

            <h2 class="paraheading">University Experiences</h2>
            <pre class="stdtxt">
                This is current my 2nd year in university, as I was unfortunately unable to do Web Systems in my first year.
                However, because of this I have already completed a few programming based subjects before doing this subject.
                This includes:
            </pre>
            <ul class="stdtxt">
                <li>Programming Fundamentals</li>
                <li>Applications Programming</li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="stdtxt">
                Along with this, I have also been experimenting with various softwares that I have barely used during my 
                high school days such as Adobe Photoshop and Premiere. These softwares have been an integral part of
                my workflow ever since I started using them for assignments and projects.

        <div class="paragraph">
            <h2 class="paraheading">Other Experiences</h2>
            <pre class="stdtxt">
                Outside of university and school my computing experiences are not very diverse, often involving troubleshooting
                my devices at home (especially anything to do with the printer). Besides this, I have dabbled in port
                forwarding and IP configuration at home during some attempts to create a server within a few multiplayer
                games.
